Where the mind Is without fear                                
And the head Is held high                                     
Where knowledge Is free                                       
Where the world has not been broken up                        
Into fragments by narrow domestic wolls                       
Where words come out from the depth of truth                  
Where tireless striving stretches its arms tov/ards perfection
Where the clear streom of reason has not lost its way         
Into the dreary desert sand of dead habit                     
Where the mind is led forward by thee                         
Into ever-widening thought and action                         
Into that heoven of freedom, my father, let my country        
awake
